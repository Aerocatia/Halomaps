This is a read-only recreation of the Halomaps forum. Browse our hosted instance: [Link coming soon]

## Motivation
On February 1, 2023, the forum of [Halomaps](http://halomaps.org) (http://forum.halomaps.org) was shut down. This forum was a long-standing, invaluable repository of knowledge for modding Halo CE. Prior to this shut down, the entirety of the forum was crawled and scraped using a [`wget` script](). This is a read-only recreation of that forum using the scraped content, in order to preserve it for the community.

## Download
The archive can also be downloaded separately:
- [As a series of mostly-complete HTML pages]()
  - (Warning: unzips to a directory containing **52,000** files that total **1.6GB**! This can cripple some file browsers!)
- [As a SQLite3 database]()


(Links will be filled in once this stuff is actually completed / hosted somewhere)
